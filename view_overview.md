so what are my views doing 
    -application folder 
        -welcome.html.erb 
            this is just a welcome page that has an h1 that has a string in it and a link to a page that has
            all of the dealerships 

    - cars folder 
        -show.html.erb 
            this is showing a link to test drive that specfic car (wile interpolating its name )
            then there is another link to to go back and see a dealerships interventory (ik its spelled wrong)

    -dealership
        -index.html.erb
